It is\nupdated periodically to reflect changes made by political bodies to time\nzone boundaries, UTC offsets, and daylight saving time rules.\nAdditionally, this package provides a C++ interface for working with the\n'date' library. 'date' provides comprehensive support for working with\ndates and date-times, which this package exposes to make it easier for\nother R packages to utilize. Headers are provided for calendar specific\ncalculations, along with a limited interface for time zone\nmanipulations.\n",
