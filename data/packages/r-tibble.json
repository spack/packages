Europe PMC indexes all PubMed content and other literature\nsources including Agricola, a bibliographic database of citations to the\nagricultural literature, or Biological Patents. In addition to\nbibliographic metadata, the client allows users to fetch citations and\nreference lists. Links between life-science literature and other EBI\ndatabases, including ENA, PDB or ChEMBL are also accessible. No\nregistration or API key is required. See the vignettes for usage\nexamples."

Once VCF data is read into R a parser\nfunction extracts matrices of data. This information can then be used\nfor quality control or other purposes. Additional functions provide\nvisualization of genomic data. Once processing is complete data may be\nwritten to a VCF file (*.vcf.gz). It also may be converted into other\npopular R objects (e.g., genlight, DNAbin). VcfR provides a link between\nVCF data and familiar R software."
