The two workhorse\nfunctions are Cache and prepInputs; these allow for: nested caching,\nrobust to environments, and objects with environments (like functions);\nand data retrieval and processing in continuous workflow environments.\nIn all cases, efforts are made to make the first and subsequent calls of\nfunctions have the same result, but vastly faster at subsequent times by\nway of checksums and digesting. Several features are still under active\ndevelopment, including cloud storage of cached objects, allowing for\nsharing between users. Several advanced options are available, see\n?reproducibleOptions."
