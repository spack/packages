    "description": "ARPACK-NG is a collection of Fortran77 subroutines designed to solve\nlarge scale eigenvalue problems. Important Features: * Reverse\nCommunication Interface. * Single and Double Precision Real Arithmetic\nVersions for Symmetric, Non-symmetric, Standard or Generalized Problems.\n* Single and Double Precision Complex Arithmetic Versions for Standard\nor Generalized Problems. * Routines for Banded Matrices - Standard or\nGeneralized Problems. * Routines for The Singular Value Decomposition. *\nExample driver routines that may be used as templates to implement\nnumerous Shift-Invert strategies for all problem types, data types and\nprecision. This project is a joint project between Debian, Octave and\nScilab in order to provide a common and maintained version of arpack.\nIndeed, no single release has been published by Rice university for the\nlast few years and since many software (Octave, Scilab, R, Matlab...)\nforked it and implemented their own modifications, arpack-ng aims to\ntackle this by providing a common repository and maintained versions.\narpack-ng is replacing arpack almost everywhere.\n",

The computationally most intensive\nphase, factorization, is accelerated via randomized linear algebras. The\nbutterfly format, originally inspired by the butterfly data flow in fast\nFourier Transform, is a linear algebra tool well-suited for compressing\nmatrices arising from high-frequency wave equations or highly\noscillatory integral operators."
