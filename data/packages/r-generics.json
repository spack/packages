Functions are also included to facilitate the analysis of\nfactorial experiments, including purely 'within-Ss' designs (repeated\nmeasures), purely 'between-Ss' designs, and mixed 'within-and-between-\nSs' designs. It's also possible to compute several effect size metrics,\nincluding \"eta squared\" for ANOVA, \"Cohen's d\" for t-test and 'Cramer V'\nfor the association between categorical variables.
