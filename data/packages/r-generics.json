Additional functions are available\nfor reshaping, reordering, manipulating and visualizing correlation\nmatrix. Functions are also included to facilitate the analysis of\nfactorial experiments, including purely 'within-Ss' designs (repeated\nmeasures), purely 'between-Ss' designs, and mixed 'within-and-between-\nSs' designs. It's also possible to compute several effect size metrics,\nincluding \"eta squared\" for ANOVA, \"Cohen's d\" for t-test and 'Cramer V'\nfor the association between categorical variables. The package contains\nhelper functions for identifying univariate and multivariate outliers,\nassessing normality and homogeneity of variances."

MICE can also impute continuous\ntwo-level data (normal model, pan, second-level variables). Passive\nimputation can be used to maintain consistency between variables.\nVarious diagnostic plots are available to inspect the quality of the\nimputations."
