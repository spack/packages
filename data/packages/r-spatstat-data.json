Also supports three-\ndimensional point patterns, space-time point patterns in any number of\ndimensions, point patterns on a linear network, and patterns of other\ngeometrical objects. Supports spatial covariate data such as pixel\nimages. Contains over 2000 functions for plotting spatial data,\nexploratory data analysis, model-fitting, simulation, spatial sampling,\nmodel diagnostics, and formal inference. Data types include point\npatterns, line segment patterns, spatial windows, pixel images,\ntessellations, and linear networks. Exploratory methods include quadrat\ncounts, K-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour\ndistance and empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair correlation\nfunction, kernel smoothed intensity, relative risk estimation with\ncross-validated bandwidth selection, mark correlation functions,\nsegregation indices, mark dependence diagnostics, and kernel estimates\nof covariate effects. Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-\nsquared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford,\nDao-Genton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-\nBerman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported.\nParametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using the\nfunctions ppm(), kppm(), slrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of\nmodels include Poisson, Gibbs and Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott\ncluster processes, and determinantal point processes. Models may involve\ndependence on covariates, inter-point interaction, cluster formation and\ndependence on marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic\nregression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods. A model\ncan be fitted to a list of point patterns (replicated point pattern\ndata) using the function mppm(). The model can include random effects\nand fixed effects depending on the experimental design, in addition to\nall the features listed above. Fitted point process models can be\nsimulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are\nsupported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo\ntests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC())\nand variable selection (sdr). Tools for validating the fitted model\ninclude simulation envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots,\nleverage and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added\nvariable plots."
