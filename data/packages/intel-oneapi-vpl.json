    "description": "The Intel oneAPI Video Processing Library (oneVPL) is the successor to\nIntel Media SDK. This library takes you from abstractions for integrated\ngraphics to using oneVPL to unlock media features on a much broader\nrange of accelerators. oneVPL provides a single, video-focused API for\nencoding, decoding, and video processing that works across a wide range\nof accelerators. The library is perfect for applications spanning\nbroadcasting, streaming, video on demand (VOD), in-cloud gaming, and\nremote desktop solutions.
