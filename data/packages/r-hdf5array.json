    "description": "HDF5 backend for DelayedArray objects. Implements the HDF5Array and\nTENxMatrix classes, 2 convenient and memory-efficient array-like\ncontainers for on-disk representation of HDF5 datasets. HDF5Array is for\ndatasets that use the conventional (i.e. dense) HDF5 representation.\nTENxMatrix is for datasets that use the HDF5-based sparse matrix\nrepresentation from 10x Genomics (e.g. the 1.3 Million Brain Cell\nDataset). Both containers being DelayedArray extensions, they support\nall operations supported by DelayedArray objects. These operations can\nbe either delayed or block-processed.\n",

In order to\nreduce memory usage and optimize performance, operations on the object\nare either delayed or executed using a block processing mechanism. Note\nthat this also works on in-memory array-like objects like DataFrame\nobjects (typically with Rle columns), Matrix objects, and ordinary\narrays and data frames."
