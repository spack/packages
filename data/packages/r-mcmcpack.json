Most simulation is done in compiled C++ written in\nthe Scythe Statistical Library Version 1.0.3. All models return 'coda'\nmcmc objects that can then be summarized using the 'coda' package. Some\nuseful utility functions such as density functions, pseudo-random number\ngenerators for statistical distributions, a general purpose Metropolis\nsampling algorithm, and tools for visualization are provided.\n",
