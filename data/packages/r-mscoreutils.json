These functions include mass spectra processing\nfunctions (noise estimation, smoothing, binning), quantitative\naggregation functions (median polish, robust summarisation, ...),\nmissing data imputation, data normalisation (quantiles, vsn, ...) as\nwell as misc helper functions, that are used across high-level data\nstructure within the R for Mass Spectrometry packages.\n",

Package developers can easily implement vector-like or list-\nlike objects as concrete subclasses of Vector or List. In addition, a\nfew low-level concrete subclasses of general interest (e.g. DataFrame,\nRle, and Hits) are implemented in the S4Vectors package itself (many\nmore are implemented in the IRanges package and in other Bioconductor\ninfrastructure packages)."
