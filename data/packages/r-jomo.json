Multiple random effect terms are allowed and\nthey may be nested, crossed or partially nested/crossed. Restrictions of\nsymmetry and equidistance can be imposed on the thresholds (cut-\npoints/intercepts). Standard model methods are available (summary,\nanova, drop-methods, step, confint, predict etc.) in addition to profile\nmethods and slice methods for visualizing the likelihood function and\nchecking convergence."
