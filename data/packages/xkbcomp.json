    "description": "The X Keyboard (XKB) Extension essentially replaces the core protocol\ndefinition of a keyboard. The extension makes it possible to specify\nclearly and explicitly most aspects of keyboard behaviour on a per-key\nbasis, and to track more closely the logical and physical state of a\nkeyboard. It also includes a number of keyboard controls designed to\nmake keyboards more accessible to people with physical impairments.\n",
