    "description": "Unicycler is an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. It can assemble\nIllumina-only read sets where it functions as a SPAdes-optimiser. It can\nalso assembly long-read-only sets (PacBio or Nanopore) where it runs a\nminiasm+Racon pipeline. For the best possible assemblies, give it both\nIllumina reads and long reads, and it will conduct a hybrid assembly.\n",
