You may specify various flags to the function to affect its\nbehaviour; most notably, it defaults to automatically chomp the input,\nunless the -line flag is specified. Two other functions are exported at\nrequest: hand_print, which simulates hand-typing to the console; and\nget_input, which is the lower-level function that actually prompts the\nuser for a suitable input. Note that this is an interim re-release. A\nfull release with better documentation will follow in the near future.\nMeanwhile, please consult the examples directory from this module's CPAN\ndistribution to better understand how to make use of this module."
