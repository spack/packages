Whole genome\nresequencing of pools of recombinant mutant genomes allows directly\nlinking phenotypic traits to causal mutations. Such an analysis, called\nmapping-by-sequencing, combines classical genetic mapping and next\ngeneration sequencing by relying on selection-induced patterns within\ngenome-wide allele frequency in pooled genomes."
