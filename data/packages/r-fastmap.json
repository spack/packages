    "description": "Fast Implementation of a Key-Value Store. Fast implementation of a key-\nvalue store. Environments are commonly used as key-value stores, but\nevery time a new key is used, it is added to R's global symbol table,\ncausing a small amount of memory leakage. This can be problematic in\ncases where many different keys are used. Fastmap avoids this memory\nleak issue by implementing the map using data structures in C++.\n",
