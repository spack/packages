The exponential\nintegrals E_1(x), E_2(x), E_n(x) and Ei(x), and the incomplete gamma\nfunction G(a, x) defined for negative values of its first argument. The\npackage also gives easy access to the underlying C routines through an\nAPI; see the package vignette for details. A test package included in\nsub-directory example_API provides an implementation. C routines derived\nfrom the GNU Scientific Library <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>.\n",
