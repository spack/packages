    "description": "CLAPACK is a f2c'ed version of LAPACK. The CLAPACK library was built\nusing a Fortran to C conversion utility called f2c. The entire Fortran\n77 LAPACK library is run through f2c to obtain C code, and then modified\nto improve readability. CLAPACK's goal is to provide LAPACK for someone\nwho does not have access to a Fortran compiler.\n",
