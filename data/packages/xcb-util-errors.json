    "description": "The XCB util modules provides a number of libraries which sit on top of\nlibxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension\nlibraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions\nand interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the\nlibraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of\nthe X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.\n",
