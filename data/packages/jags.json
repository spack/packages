Template model specifications can\nbe generated using a standard lme4-style formula interface to assist\nusers less familiar with the BUGS syntax. A JAGS extension module\nprovides additional distributions including the Pareto family of\ndistributions, the DuMouchel prior and the half-Cauchy prior."
