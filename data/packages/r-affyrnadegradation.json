The package helps with the assessment and correction of RNA\ndegradation effects in Affymetrix 3' expression arrays. The parameter d\ngives a robust and accurate measure of RNA integrity. The correction\nremoves the probe positional bias, and thus improves comparability of\nsamples that are affected by RNA degradation.\n",
