    "description": "mpiFileUtils is a suite of MPI-based tools to manage large datasets,\nwhich may vary from large directory trees to large files. High-\nperformance computing users often generate large datasets with parallel\napplications that run with many processes (millions in some cases).\nHowever those users are then stuck with single-process tools like cp and\nrm to manage their datasets. This suite provides MPI-based tools to\nhandle typical jobs like copy, remove, and compare for such datasets,\nproviding speedups of up to 20-30x.\n",
