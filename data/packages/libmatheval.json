It supports expressions in\nany number of variables of arbitrary names, decimal and symbolic\nconstants, basic unary and binary operators, and elementary mathematical\nfunctions. In addition to parsing and evaluation, libmatheval can also\ncompute symbolic derivatives and output expressions to strings.\n",
