    "description": "Dispersion shrinkage for sequencing data. DSS is an R library performing\ndifferntial analysis for count-based sequencing data. It detectes\ndifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) from RNA-seq, and differentially\nmethylated loci or regions (DML/DMRs) from bisulfite sequencing (BS-\nseq). The core of DSS is a new dispersion shrinkage method for\nestimating the dispersion parameter from Gamma-Poisson or Beta-Binomial\ndistributions.\n",

Wrapping an array-like object (typically an on-disk\nobject) in a DelayedArray object allows one to perform common array\noperations on it without loading the object in memory. In order to\nreduce memory usage and optimize performance, operations on the object\nare either delayed or executed using a block processing mechanism. Note\nthat this also works on in-memory array-like objects like DataFrame\nobjects (typically with Rle columns), Matrix objects, and ordinary\narrays and data frames."
