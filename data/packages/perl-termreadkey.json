    "description": "Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing simple\ncontrol over terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.,) support\nfor non-blocking reads, if the architecture allows, and some generalized\nhandy functions for working with terminals. One of the main goals is to\nhave the functions as portable as possible, so you can just plug in \"use\nTerm::ReadKey\" on any architecture and have a good likelihood of it\nworking.\n",

You may specify various flags to the function to affect its\nbehaviour; most notably, it defaults to automatically chomp the input,\nunless the -line flag is specified. Two other functions are exported at\nrequest: hand_print, which simulates hand-typing to the console; and\nget_input, which is the lower-level function that actually prompts the\nuser for a suitable input. Note that this is an interim re-release. A\nfull release with better documentation will follow in the near future.\nMeanwhile, please consult the examples directory from this module's CPAN\ndistribution to better understand how to make use of this module."
