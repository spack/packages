Data types defined on a\nnetwork include point patterns, pixel images, functions, and\ntessellations.

Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared,\nKolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-\nGenton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-\nBerman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported.\nParametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using the function\nlppm() similar to glm().

Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model\nare supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo\ntests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC())\nand variable selection (sdr).
