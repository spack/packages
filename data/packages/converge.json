    "description": "CONVERGE is a revolutionary computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program\nthat eliminates the grid generation bottleneck from the simulation\nprocess. CONVERGE was developed by engine simulation experts and is\nstraightforward to use for both engine and non-engine simulations.\nUnlike many CFD programs, CONVERGE automatically generates a perfectly\northogonal, structured grid at runtime based on simple, user-defined\ngrid control parameters. This grid generation method completely\neliminates the need to manually generate a grid. In addition, CONVERGE\noffers many other features to expedite the setup process and to ensure\nthat your simulations are as computationally efficient as possible.\n",
