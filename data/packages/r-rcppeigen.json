    "description": "'Rcpp' Integration for the 'Eigen' Templated Linear Algebra Library R\nand 'Eigen' integration using 'Rcpp'. 'Eigen' is a C++ template library\nfor linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers and related\nalgorithms. It supports dense and sparse matrices on integer, floating\npoint and complex numbers, decompositions of such matrices, and\nsolutions of linear systems. Its performance on many algorithms is\ncomparable with some of the best implementations based on 'Lapack' and\nlevel-3 'BLAS'. The 'RcppEigen' package includes the header files from\nthe 'Eigen' C++ template library (currently version 3.2.8). Thus users\ndo not need to install 'Eigen' itself in order to use 'RcppEigen'. Since\nversion 3.1.1, 'Eigen' is licensed under the Mozilla Public License\n(version 2); earlier version were licensed under the GNU LGPL version 3\nor later. 'RcppEigen' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to 'Eigen') is\nlicensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of 'Rcpp'.\n",
