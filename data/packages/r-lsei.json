    "description": "Solving Least Squares or Quadratic Programming Problems under\nEquality/Inequality Constraints. It contains functions that solve least\nsquares linear regression problems under linear equality/inequality\nconstraints. Functions for solving quadratic programming problems are\nalso available, which transform such problems into least squares ones\nfirst. It is developed based on the 'Fortran' program of Lawson and\nHanson (1974, 1995), which is public domain and available at\n<http://www.netlib.org/lawson-hanson>.\n",
