    "description": "When writing a library it is very useful to log information. However\nthere are many logging implementations out there, and a library cannot\nimpose the use of a particular one on the overall application that the\nlibrary is a part of. The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge\nbetween different logging implementations. A library that uses the\ncommons-logging API can be used with any logging implementation at\nruntime. Commons-logging comes with support for a number of popular\nlogging implementations, and writing adapters for others is a reasonably\nsimple task.\n",
