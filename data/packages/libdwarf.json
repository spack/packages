It was developed by a committee (known as\nthe PLSIG at the time) starting around 1991. Starting around 1991 SGI\ndeveloped the libdwarf and dwarfdump tools for internal use and as part\nof SGI IRIX developer tools. Since that time dwarfdump and libdwarf have\nbeen shipped (as an executable and archive respectively, not source)\nwith every release of the SGI MIPS/IRIX C compiler.\n",
