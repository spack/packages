    "description": "Apache Kylin is an open source, distributed Analytical Data Warehouse\nfor Big Data; it was designed to provide OLAP (Online Analytical\nProcessing) capability in the big data era. By renovating the multi-\ndimensional cube and precalculation technology on Hadoop and Spark,\nKylin is able to achieve near constant query speed regardless of the\never-growing data volume. Reducing query latency from minutes to sub-\nsecond, Kylin brings online analytics back to big data.\n",
