    "description": "Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models An implementation of about\n6 major classes of statistical regression models. The central algorithm\nis Fisher scoring and iterative reweighted least squares. At the heart\nof this package are the vector generalized linear and additive model\n(VGLM/VGAM) classes. VGLMs can be loosely thought of as multivariate\nGLMs. VGAMs are data-driven VGLMs that use smoothing. The book \"Vector\nGeneralized Linear and Additive Models: With an Implementation in R\"\n(Yee, 2015) <DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7> gives details of the\nstatistical framework and the package. Currently only fixed-effects\nmodels are implemented. Many (150+) models and distributions are\nestimated by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or penalized MLE. The\nother classes are RR-VGLMs (reduced-rank VGLMs), quadratic RR-VGLMs,\nreduced-rank VGAMs, RCIMs (row-column interaction models)---these\nclasses perform constrained and unconstrained quadratic ordination\n(CQO/UQO) models in ecology, as well as constrained additive ordination\n(CAO). Hauck-Donner effect detection is implemented. Note that these\nfunctions are subject to change; see the NEWS and ChangeLog files for\nlatest changes.\n",
