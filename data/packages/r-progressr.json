    "description": "An Inclusive, Unifying API for Progress Updates. A minimal, unifying API\nfor scripts and packages to report progress updates from anywhere\nincluding when using parallel processing. The package is designed such\nthat the developer can to focus on what progress should be reported on\nwithout having to worry about how to present it. The end user has full\ncontrol of how, where, and when to render these progress updates, e.g.\nin the terminal using utils::txtProgressBar() or\nprogress::progress_bar(), in a graphical user interface using\nutils::winProgressBar(), tcltk::tkProgressBar() or\nshiny::withProgress(), via the speakers using beep::beepr(), or on a\nfile system via the size of a file. Anyone can add additional,\ncustomized, progression handlers. The 'progressr' package uses R's\ncondition framework for signaling progress updated. Because of this,\nprogress can be reported from almost anywhere in R, e.g. from classical\nfor and while loops, from map-reduce API:s like the lapply() family of\nfunctions, 'purrr', 'plyr', and 'foreach'. It will also work with\nparallel processing via the 'future' framework, e.g.\nfuture.apply::future_lapply(), furrr::future_map(), and 'foreach' with\n'doFuture'. The package is compatible with Shiny applications.\n",

Implementation of a function\n'digest()' for the creation of hash digests of arbitrary R objects\n(using the md5, sha-1, sha-256, crc32, xxhash and murmurhash algorithms)\npermitting easy comparison of R language objects, as well as a function\n'hmac()' to create hash-based message authentication code. The md5\nalgorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the sha-1 and sha-256\nalgorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2, and the crc32\nalgorithm is described in\nftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt. For md5,\nsha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone\nimplementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code\nfrom the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron\nD. Gifford is used. For xxhash, the implementation by Yann Collet is\nused. For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane Day is used. Please\nnote that this package is not meant to be deployed for cryptographic\npurposes for which more comprehensive (and widely tested) libraries such\nas OpenSSL should be used."
