All methods are applicable to\n(generalized) linear model objects fitted by lm() and glm() but can also\nbe adapted to other classes through S3 methods. Details can be found in\nZeileis et al.

Heiberger and Burt Holland. This\ncontemporary presentation of statistical methods features extensive use\nof graphical displays for exploring data and for displaying the\nanalysis. The second edition includes redesigned graphics and additional\nchapters. The authors emphasize how to construct and interpret graphs,\ndiscuss principles of graphical design, and show how accompanying\ntraditional tabular results are used to confirm the visual impressions\nderived directly from the graphs. Many of the graphical formats are\nnovel and appear here for the first time in print. All chapters have\nexercises. All functions introduced in the book are in the package. R\ncode for all examples, both graphs and tables, in the book is included\nin the scripts directory of the package."

'rms' works with almost any regression model,\nbut it was especially written to work with binary or ordinal regression\nmodels, Cox regression, accelerated failure time models, ordinary linear\nmodels, the Buckley-James model, generalized least squares for serially\nor spatially correlated observations, generalized linear models, and\nquantile regression."
