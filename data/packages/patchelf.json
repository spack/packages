GTPin includes a\nbinary instrumentation engine for Intel(R) GPUs EUs, along with an API\nfor developing analysis tools, and many sample tools. GTPin allows you\nto capture a range of dynamic profiling data at the finest granularity\nof the specific GPU EU instruction. GTPin supports both compute and\ngraphics workloads. It operates on regular, real-world GPU applications,\nas well as on pre-captured API streams. The technology enables fast and\naccurate dynamic analysis of the code that is executing on the GPU EUs.\nGTPin opens up new opportunities to perform dynamic, low level workload\nand HW analysis on an Intel(R) GPU, with greater efficiency than other\ncurrent solutions. Some of the GTPin capabilities are integrated into\nIntel(R) VTune(TM) Profiler, Intel(R) Advisor, and the Intel(R) Graphics\nPerformance Analyzers (Intel(R) GPA). GTPin is available, along with a\nset of analysis tools based on the GTPin framework. It also enables more\nadvanced users to develop their own analysis tools. GTPin can analyze\nany GPU application. It also collects dynamic profiling data which the\napplication executes on the GPU."
