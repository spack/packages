Useful for analyzing data from standard RNA-seq or meta-RNA-\nseq assays as well as selected and unselected values from in-vitro\nsequence selections. Uses a Dirichlet-multinomial model to infer\nabundance from counts, optimized for three or more experimental\nreplicates. The method infers biological and sampling variation to\ncalculate the expected false discovery rate, given the variation, based\non a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and Welch's t-test (via aldex.ttest), a\nKruskal-Wallis test (via aldex.kw), a generalized linear model (via\naldex.glm), or a correlation test (via aldex.corr). All tests report\np-values and Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values."
