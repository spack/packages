    "description": "BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian inference using MCMC of\nmolecular sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-\nmeasured phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock\nmodels. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is\nalso a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without\nconditioning on a single tree topology.\n",
