Asynchronous programming is useful for allowing a single R\nprocess to orchestrate multiple tasks in the background while also\nattending to something else. Semantics are similar to 'JavaScript'\npromises, but with a syntax that is idiomatic R.\n",

These classes allow public and private\nmembers, and they support inheritance, even when the classes are defined\nin different packages."
