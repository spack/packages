    "description": "libXTrap is the Xlib-based client API for the DEC-XTRAP extension. XTrap\nwas a proposed standard extension for X11R5 which facilitated the\ncapturing of server protocol and synthesizing core input events. Digital\nparticipated in the X Consortium's xtest working group which chose to\nevolve XTrap functionality into the XTEST & RECORD extensions for X11R6.\nAs X11R6 was released in 1994, XTrap has now been deprecated for over 15\nyears, and uses of it should be quite rare.\n",
