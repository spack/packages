Currently it works on Linux and\nMac with hardware supported by gr-osmosdr, including Funcube Dongle,\nRTL-SDR, Airspy, HackRF, BladeRF, RFSpace, USRP and SoapySDR. Gqrx can\noperate as an AM/FM/SSB receiver with audio output or as an FFT-only\ninstrument. There are also various hooks for interacting with external\napplication using nertwork sockets.\n",
