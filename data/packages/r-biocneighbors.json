    "description": "Nearest Neighbor Detection for Bioconductor Packages. Implements exact\nand approximate methods for nearest neighbor detection, in a framework\nthat allows them to be easily switched within Bioconductor packages or\nworkflows. Exact searches can be performed using the k-means for\nk-nearest neighbors algorithm or with vantage point trees. Approximate\nsearches can be performed using the Annoy or HNSW libraries. Searching\non either Euclidean or Manhattan distances is supported. Parallelization\nis achieved for all methods by using BiocParallel. Functions are also\nprovided to search for all neighbors within a given distance.\n",
