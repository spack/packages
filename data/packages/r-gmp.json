All-pairs multiple comparisons tests (Tukey-Kramer test,\nScheffe test, LSD-test) and many-to-one tests (Dunnett test) for\nnormally distributed residuals and equal within variance are available.\nFurthermore, all-pairs tests (Games-Howell test, Tamhane's T2 test,\nDunnett T3 test, Ury-Wiggins-Hochberg test) and many-to-one (Tamhane-\nDunnett Test) for normally distributed residuals and heterogeneous\nvariances are provided.

The Kruskal-Wallis, BWS\nand Anderson-Darling omnibus test and all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test,\nDunn test, Conover test, Dwass-Steele-Critchlow- Fligner test) as well\nas many-to-one (Nemenyi test, Dunn test, U-test) are given for the\nanalysis of variance by ranks. Non-parametric trend tests (Jonckheere\ntest, Cuzick test, Johnson-Mehrotra test, Spearman test) are included.\nIn addition, a Friedman-test for one-way ANOVA with repeated measures on\nranks (CRBD) and Skillings-Mack test for unbalanced CRBD is provided\nwith consequent all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test, Siegel test, Miller test,\nConover test, Exact test) and many-to-one tests (Nemenyi test, Demsar\ntest, Exact test). A trend can be tested with Pages's test. Durbin's\ntest for a two-way balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is given in\nthis package as well as Gore's test for CRBD with multiple observations\nper cell is given. Outlier tests, Mandel's k- and h statistic as well as\nfunctions for Type I error and Power analysis as well as generic\nsummary, print and plot methods are provided."
