'rms' works with almost any regression model,\nbut it was especially written to work with binary or ordinal regression\nmodels, Cox regression, accelerated failure time models, ordinary linear\nmodels, the Buckley-James model, generalized least squares for serially\nor spatially correlated observations, generalized linear models, and\nquantile regression."
