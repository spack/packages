    "description": "Tools for Working with Posterior Distributions. Provides useful tools\nfor both users and developers of packages for fitting Bayesian models or\nworking with output from Bayesian models. The primary goals of the\npackage are to: (a) Efficiently convert between many different useful\nformats of draws (samples) from posterior or prior distributions. (b)\nProvide consistent methods for operations commonly performed on draws,\nfor example, subsetting, binding, or mutating draws. (c) Provide various\nsummaries of draws in convenient formats. (d) Provide lightweight\nimplementations of state of the art posterior inference diagnostics.\nReferences: Vehtari et al. (2021) <doi:10.1214/20-BA1221>.\n",

In addition, all parameters of the response\ndistribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional\nregression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage\nusers to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.\nModel fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive\nchecks and leave-one-out cross-validation.
