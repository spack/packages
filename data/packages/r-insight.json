A tool to\nprovide an easy, intuitive and consistent access to information\ncontained in various R models, like model formulas, model terms,\ninformation about random effects, data that was used to fit the model or\ndata from response variables. 'insight' mainly revolves around two types\nof functions: Functions that find (the names of) information, starting\nwith 'find_', and functions that get the underlying data, starting with\n'get_'. The package has a consistent syntax and works with many\ndifferent model objects, where otherwise functions to access these\ninformation are missing.\n",
