The GenomicRanges package defines\ngeneral purpose containers for storing and manipulating genomic\nintervals and variables defined along a genome. More specialized\ncontainers for representing and manipulating short alignments against a\nreference genome, or a matrix-like summarization of an experiment, are\ndefined in the GenomicAlignments and SummarizedExperiment packages,\nrespectively. Both packages build on top of the GenomicRanges\ninfrastructure."
