However, meeting the significant orchestration challenges\npresented by exascale systems requires that the process-to-system\ninterface evolve to permit a tighter integration between the different\ncomponents of the parallel application and existing and future SMS\nsolutions. PMI Exascale (PMIx) addresses these needs by providing an\nextended version of the PMI definitions specifically designed to support\nexascale and beyond environments by: (a) adding flexibility to the\nfunctionality expressed in the existing APIs, (b) augmenting the\ninterfaces with new APIs that provide extended capabilities, (c) forging\na collaboration between subsystem providers including resource manager,\nfabric, file system, and programming library developers, (d)\nestablishing a standards-like body for maintaining the definitions, and\n(e) providing a reference implementation of the PMIx standard that\ndemonstrates the desired level of scalability while maintaining strict\nseparation between it and the standard itself."
