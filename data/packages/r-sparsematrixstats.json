High\nperformance functions for row and column operations on sparse matrices.\nFor example: col / rowMeans2, col / rowMedians, col / rowVars etc.\nCurrently, the optimizations are limited to data in the column sparse\nformat. This package is inspired by the matrixStats package by Henrik\nBengtsson.\n",
