It allows users to choose\nfrom different mesh representations either at initialization\n(implemented) or during the program execution (not yet implemented) so\nthat the optimal data structures are used for the particular algorithm.\nThe interaction of users and applications with MSTK is through a\nfunctional interface that acts as though the mesh always contains\nvertices, edges, faces and regions and maintains connectivity between\nall these entities."
