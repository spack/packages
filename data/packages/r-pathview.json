    "description": "a tool set for pathway based data integration and visualization.\nPathview is a tool set for pathway based data integration and\nvisualization. It maps and renders a wide variety of biological data on\nrelevant pathway graphs. All users need is to supply their data and\nspecify the target pathway. Pathview automatically downloads the pathway\ngraph data, parses the data file, maps user data to the pathway, and\nrender pathway graph with the mapped data. In addition, Pathview also\nseamlessly integrates with pathway and gene set (enrichment) analysis\ntools for large-scale and fully automated analysis.\n",
