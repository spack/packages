It aids in the creation of Gaussian input files, enables the\nuser to run Gaussian calculations from a graphical interface without the\nneed for using a command line instruction, and helps in the\ninterpretation of Gaussian output. Needs post-install steps to make it\nrun! See package installation logs for details.\n",
