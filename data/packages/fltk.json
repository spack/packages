FLTK provides modern\nGUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D graphics via OpenGL\nand its built-in GLUT emulation. FLTK is designed to be small and\nmodular enough to be statically linked, but works fine as a shared\nlibrary. FLTK also includes an excellent UI builder called FLUID that\ncan be used to create applications in minutes.\n",
