Major effort has been made in making\ndefinition of methods as simple as possible with a minimum of\nmaintenance for package developers. For example, generic functions are\ncreated automatically, if missing, and naming conflict are automatically\nsolved, if possible. The method setMethodS3() is a good start for those\nwho in the future may want to migrate to S4. This is a cross-platform\npackage implemented in pure R that generates standard S3 methods.\n",

The next time the function is called with the same set of\nparameters, the results are momentarily retrieved from the cache\navoiding repeating the calculations. With this package, any R object can\nbe cached in a key-value storage where the key can be an arbitrary set\nof R objects. The cache memory is persistent (on the file system)."
