            "description": "MAKER is a portable and easily configurable genome annotation pipeline.\nIt's purpose is to allow smaller eukaryotic and prokaryotic\ngenomeprojects to independently annotate their genomes and to create\ngenome databases. MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to\na genome, produces ab-initio gene predictions and automatically\nsynthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based\nquality values. MAKER is also easily trainable: outputs of preliminary\nruns can be used to automatically retrain its gene prediction algorithm,\nproducing higher quality gene-models on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs\nare minimal and its ouputs can be directly loaded into a GMOD database.\nThey can also be viewed in the Apollo genome browser; this feature of\nMAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view and edit individual\ncontigs and BACs without the overhead of a database. MAKER should prove\nespecially useful for emerging model organism projects with minimal\nbioinformatics expertise and computer resources. Note: MAKER requires\nregistration.
