For example, generic functions are\ncreated automatically, if missing, and naming conflict are automatically\nsolved, if possible. The method setMethodS3() is a good start for those\nwho in the future may want to migrate to S4. This is a cross-platform\npackage implemented in pure R that generates standard S3 methods."
