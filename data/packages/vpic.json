    "description": "VPIC is a general purpose particle-in-cell simulation code for modeling\nkinetic plasmas in one, two, or three spatial dimensions. It employs a\nsecond-order, explicit, leapfrog algorithm to update charged particle\npositions and velocities in order to solve the relativistic kinetic\nequation for each species in the plasma, along with a full Maxwell\ndescription for the electric and magnetic fields evolved via a second-\norder finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) solve.\n",
