Fonts in\nPortable Compiled Format can be read by any architecture, although the\nfile is structured to allow one particular architecture to read them\ndirectly without reformatting. This allows fast reading on the\nappropriate machine, but the files are still portable (but read more\nslowly) on other machines.\n",

It is used by the X servers, the X Font\nServer (xfs), and some font utilities (bdftopcf for instance), but\nshould not be used by normal X11 clients. X11 clients access fonts via\neither the new API's in libXft, or the legacy API's in libX11."
