    "description": "Check is a unit testing framework for C. It features a simple interface\nfor defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the developer.\nTests are run in a separate address space, so both assertion failures\nand code errors that cause segmentation faults or other signals can be\ncaught. Test results are reportable in the following: Subunit, TAP, XML,\nand a generic logging format.\n",
