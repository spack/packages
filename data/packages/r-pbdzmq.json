This package provides high level R wrapper\nfunctions to easily utilize 'ZeroMQ'. We mainly focus on interactive\nclient/server programming frameworks. For convenience, a minimal\n'ZeroMQ' library (4.1.0 rc1) is shipped with 'pbdZMQ', which can be used\nif no system installation of 'ZeroMQ' is available. A few wrapper\nfunctions compatible with 'rzmq' are also provided.\n",
