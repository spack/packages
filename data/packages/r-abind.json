            "description": "Bayesian Regression Models using 'Stan': Fit Bayesian generalized\n(non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using 'Stan' for full\nBayesian inference. A wide range of distributions and link functions are\nsupported, allowing users to fit - among others - linear, robust linear,\ncount data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle,\nand even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context.\nFurther modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-\ncorrelation structures, censored data, meta-analytic standard errors,\nand quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response\ndistribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional\nregression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage\nusers to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.\nModel fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive\nchecks and leave-one-out cross-validation.

Heiberger and Burt Holland. This\ncontemporary presentation of statistical methods features extensive use\nof graphical displays for exploring data and for displaying the\nanalysis. The second edition includes redesigned graphics and additional\nchapters. The authors emphasize how to construct and interpret graphs,\ndiscuss principles of graphical design, and show how accompanying\ntraditional tabular results are used to confirm the visual impressions\nderived directly from the graphs. Many of the graphical formats are\nnovel and appear here for the first time in print. All chapters have\nexercises. All functions introduced in the book are in the package. R\ncode for all examples, both graphs and tables, in the book is included\nin the scripts directory of the package."
