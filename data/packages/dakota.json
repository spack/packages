    "description": "The Dakota toolkit provides a flexible, extensible interface between\nanalysis codes and iterative systems analysis methods. Dakota contains\nalgorithms for: - optimization with gradient and non gradient-based\nmethods; - uncertainty quantification with sampling, reliability,\nstochastic - expansion, and epistemic methods; - parameter estimation\nwith nonlinear least squares methods; - sensitivity/variance analysis\nwith design of experiments and - parameter study methods. These\ncapabilities may be used on their own or as components within advanced\nstrategies such as hybrid optimization, surrogate-based optimization,\nmixed integer nonlinear programming, or optimization under uncertainty.\n",
