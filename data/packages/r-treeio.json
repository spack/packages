    "description": "Base Classes and Functions for Phylogenetic Tree Input and Output.\n'treeio' is an R package to make it easier to import and store\nphylogenetic tree with associated data; and to link external data from\ndifferent sources to phylogeny. It also supports exporting phylogenetic\ntree with heterogeneous associated data to a single tree file and can be\nserved as a platform for merging tree with associated data and\nconverting file formats.\n",

Functions for reading, writing,\nplotting, and manipulating phylogenetic trees, analyses of comparative\ndata in a phylogenetic framework, ancestral character analyses, analyses\nof diversification and macroevolution, computing distances from DNA\nsequences, reading and writing nucleotide sequences as well as importing\nfrom BioConductor, and several tools such as Mantel's test, generalized\nskyline plots, graphical exploration of phylogenetic data (alex, trex,\nkronoviz), estimation of absolute evolutionary rates and clock-like\ntrees using mean path lengths and penalized likelihood, dating trees\nwith non-contemporaneous sequences, translating DNA into AA sequences,\nand assessing sequence alignments. Phylogeny estimation can be done with\nthe NJ, BIONJ, ME, MVR, SDM, and triangle methods, and several methods\nhandling incomplete distance matrices (NJ*, BIONJ*, MVR*, and the\ncorresponding triangle method). Some functions call external\napplications (PhyML, Clustal, T-Coffee, Muscle) whose results are\nreturned into R."

The package offers flexible, robust, high performance tools\nfor working with JSON in R and is particularly powerful for building\npipelines and interacting with a web API. The implementation is based on\nthe mapping described in the vignette (Ooms, 2014). In addition to\nconverting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to\nstream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included with\nthe package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded\nconsistently for use with dynamic data in systems and applications."
