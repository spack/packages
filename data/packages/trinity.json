    "description": "Trinity, developed at the Broad Institute and the Hebrew University of\nJerusalem, represents a novel method for the efficient and robust de\nnovo reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data. Trinity\ncombines three independent software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis, and\nButterfly, applied sequentially to process large volumes of RNA-seq\nreads. Trinity partitions the sequence data into many individual de\nBruijn graphs, each representing the transcriptional complexity at a\ngiven gene or locus, and then processes each graph independently to\nextract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease apart transcripts\nderived from paralogous genes.\n",
