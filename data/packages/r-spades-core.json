The core\nDES components facilitate modularity, and easily enable the user to\ninclude additional functionality by running user-built modules. Includes\nconditional scheduling, restart after interruption, packaging of\nreusable modules, tools for developing arbitrary automated workflows,\nautomated interweaving of modules of different temporal resolution, and\ntools for visualizing and understanding the DES project.\n",

Several features are still under active\ndevelopment, including cloud storage of cached objects, allowing for\nsharing between users. Several advanced options are available, see\n?reproducibleOptions."
