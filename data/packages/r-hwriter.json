Users can generate tables with sortable and filterable columns,\nmake and display plots, and link table entries to other data sources\nsuch as NCBI or larger plots within the HTML page. Using the package,\nusers can also produce a table of contents page to link various reports\ntogether for a particular project that can be viewed in a web browser.\nFor more examples, please visit our site: http:// research-\npub.gene.com/ReportingTools."
