    "description": "Linear Group Fixed Effects. Transforms away factors with many levels\nprior to doing an OLS. Useful for estimating linear models with multiple\ngroup fixed effects, and for estimating linear models which uses factors\nwith many levels as pure control variables. See Gaure (2013)\n<doi:10.1016/j.csda.2013.03.024> Includes support for instrumental\nvariables, conditional F statistics for weak instruments, robust and\nmulti-way clustered standard errors, as well as limited mobility bias\ncorrection (Gaure 2014 <doi:10.1002/sta4.68>). WARNING: This package is\nNOT under active development anymore, no further improvements are to be\nexpected, and the package is at risk of being removed from CRAN.\n",

Starting out from the basic robust\nEicker-Huber-White sandwich covariance methods include:\nheteroscedasticity-consistent (HC) covariances for cross-section data;\nheteroscedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) covariances for\ntime series data (such as Andrews' kernel HAC, Newey-West, and WEAVE\nestimators); clustered covariances (one-way and multi-way); panel and\npanel-corrected covariances; outer-product-of-gradients covariances; and\n(clustered) bootstrap covariances. All methods are applicable to\n(generalized) linear model objects fitted by lm() and glm() but can also\nbe adapted to other classes through S3 methods. Details can be found in\nZeileis et al.
