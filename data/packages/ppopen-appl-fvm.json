    "description": " ppOpen-APPL/FVM ia a coupling library that enables weak coupling on\nvarious simulation models, such as an atmospheric model and an ocean\nmodel, a seismic model and a structure model. For getting very wide\napplicability, ppohMATHMP is designed so as that it is independent from\ngrid structure. Instead of grid structure, ppOpen-APPL/FVM requires a\ndata set called 'mapping table'. Mapping table is composed of a\ncorrespondence table of grid indexes between a send model and a receive\nmodel and interpolation coefficients. A subroutine for making a mapping\ntable file is provided by ppohMATHMP API. Current version of ppohMATHMP\nis ver.1.0 which targets scalar data exchange. An exchange code of\nvector data which requires rotation calculation is under\n",
