    "description": "MiXCR is a universal framework that processes big immunome data from raw\nsequences to quantitated clonotypes. MiXCR efficiently handles paired-\nand single-end reads, considers sequence quality, corrects PCR errors\nand identifies germline hypermutations. The software supports both\npartial- and full-length profiling and employs all available RNA or DNA\ninformation, including sequences upstream of V and downstream of J gene\nsegments.\n",
