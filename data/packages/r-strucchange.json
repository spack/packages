    "description": "Testing, Monitoring, and Dating Structural Changes. Testing, monitoring\nand dating structural changes in (linear) regression models. strucchange\nfeatures tests/methods from the generalized fluctuation test framework\nas well as from the F test (Chow test) framework. This includes methods\nto fit, plot and test fluctuation processes (e.g., CUSUM, MOSUM,\nrecursive/moving estimates) and F statistics, respectively. It is\npossible to monitor incoming data online using fluctuation processes.\nFinally, the breakpoints in regression models with structural changes\ncan be estimated together with confidence intervals. Emphasis is always\ngiven to methods for visualizing the data.\n",

The core of the package is ctree(), an\nimplementation of conditional inference trees which embed tree-\nstructured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional\ninference procedures. This non-parametric class of regression trees is\napplicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal,\nordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables\nand arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Based on conditional\ninference trees, cforest() provides an implementation of Breiman's\nrandom forests. The function mob() implements an algorithm for recursive\npartitioning based on parametric models (e.g. linear models, GLMs or\nsurvival regression) employing parameter instability tests for split\nselection. Extensible functionality for visualizing tree-structured\nregression models is available. The methods are described in Hothorn et\nal. (2006) <doi:10.1198/106186006X133933>, Zeileis et al.
