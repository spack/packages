The aim is to curate a collection of its state-of-\nthe-art variants that (1) do not sacrifice simplicity of design, (2) are\nessentially tuning-free, and (3) can be efficiently implemented directly\nin the R language. Currently, it only provides an implementation of the\n'jDE' algorithm by Brest et al. (2006) <doi:10.1109/TEVC.2006.872133>.\n",
