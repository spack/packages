    "description": "Randomized Singular Value Decomposition Low-rank matrix decompositions\nare fundamental tools and widely used for data analysis, dimension\nreduction, and data compression. Classically, highly accurate\ndeterministic matrix algorithms are used for this task. However, the\nemergence of large-scale data has severely challenged our computational\nability to analyze big data. The concept of randomness has been\ndemonstrated as an effective strategy to quickly produce approximate\nanswers to familiar problems such as the singular value decomposition\n(SVD). The rsvd package provides several randomized matrix algorithms\nsuch as the randomized singular value decomposition (rsvd), randomized\nprincipal component analysis (rpca), randomized robust principal\ncomponent analysis (rrpca), randomized interpolative decomposition\n(rid), and the randomized CUR decomposition (rcur). In addition several\nplot functions are provided. The methods are discussed in detail by\nErichson et al. (2016) <arXiv:1608.02148>.\n",
