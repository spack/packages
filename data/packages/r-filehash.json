    "description": "Simple Key-Value Database. Implements a simple key-value style database\nwhere character string keys are associated with data values that are\nstored on the disk. A simple interface is provided for inserting,\nretrieving, and deleting data from the database. Utilities are provided\nthat allow 'filehash' databases to be treated much like environments and\nlists are already used in R. These utilities are provided to encourage\ninteractive and exploratory analysis on large datasets. Three different\nfile formats for representing the database are currently available and\nnew formats can easily be incorporated by third parties for use in the\n'filehash' framework.\n",
