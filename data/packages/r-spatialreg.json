    "description": "Spatial Regression Analysis. A collection of all the estimation\nfunctions for spatial cross-sectional models (on lattice/areal data\nusing spatial weights matrices) contained up to now in 'spdep', 'sphet'\nand 'spse'. These model fitting functions include maximum likelihood\nmethods for cross-sectional models proposed by 'Cliff' and 'Ord' (1973,\nISBN:0850860369) and (1981, ISBN:0850860814), fitting methods initially\ndescribed by 'Ord' (1975) <doi:10.1080/01621459.1975.10480272>. The\nmodels are further described by 'Anselin' (1988)\n<doi:10.1007/978-94-015-7799-1>. Spatial two stage least squares and\nspatial general method of moment models initially proposed by 'Kelejian'\nand 'Prucha' (1998) <doi:10.1023/A:1007707430416> and (1999)\n<doi:10.1111/1468-2354.00027> are provided. Impact methods and MCMC\nfitting methods proposed by 'LeSage' and 'Pace' (2009)\n<doi:10.1201/9781420064254> are implemented for the family of cross-\nsectional spatial regression models. Methods for fitting the log\ndeterminant term in maximum likelihood and MCMC fitting are compared by\n'Bivand et al.' (2013) <doi:10.1111/gean.12008>, and model fitting\nmethods by 'Bivand' and 'Piras' (2015) <doi:10.18637/jss.v063.i18>; both\nof these articles include extensive lists of references. 'spatialreg' >=\n1.1-* correspond to 'spdep' >= 1.1-1, in which the model fitting\nfunctions are deprecated and pass through to 'spatialreg', but will mask\nthose in 'spatialreg'. From versions 1.2-*, the functions will be made\ndefunct in 'spdep'.\n",
