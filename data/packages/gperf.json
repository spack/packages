    "description": "GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator. For a given list of\nstrings, it produces a hash function and hash table, in form of C or C++\ncode, for looking up a value depending on the input string. The hash\nfunction is perfect, which means that the hash table has no collisions,\nand the hash table lookup needs a single string comparison only.\n",
