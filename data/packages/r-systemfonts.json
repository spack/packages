As font handling varies between systems it is difficult to\ncorrectly locate installed fonts across different operating systems. The\n'systemfonts' package provides bindings to the native libraries on\nWindows, macOS and Linux for finding font files that can then be used\nfurther by e.g. graphic devices. The main use is intended to be from\ncompiled code but 'systemfonts' also provides access from R.\n",
