Raster methods allow for low-level data manipulation as\nwell as high-level global, local, zonal, and focal computation. The\npredict and interpolate methods facilitate the use of regression type\n(interpolation, machine learning) models for spatial prediction,\nincluding with satellite remote sensing data. Processing of very large\nfiles is supported. See the manual and tutorials on\n<https://rspatial.org/terra/> to get started. 'terra' is very similar to\nthe 'raster' package; but 'terra' can do more, is easier to use, and it\nis faster.\n",
