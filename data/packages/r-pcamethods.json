    "description": "A collection of PCA methods. Provides Bayesian PCA, Probabilistic PCA,\nNipals PCA, Inverse Non-Linear PCA and the conventional SVD PCA. A\ncluster based method for missing value estimation is included for\ncomparison. BPCA, PPCA and NipalsPCA may be used to perform PCA on\nincomplete data as well as for accurate missing value estimation. A set\nof methods for printing and plotting the results is also provided. All\nPCA methods make use of the same data structure (pcaRes) to provide a\ncommon interface to the PCA results. Initiated at the Max-Planck\nInstitute for Molecular Plant Physiology, Golm, Germany.\n",
