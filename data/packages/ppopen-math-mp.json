    "description": " ppOpen-Math/MP ia a coupling library that enables weak coupling on\nvarious simulation models, such as an atmospheric model and an ocean\nmodel, a seismic model and a structure model. For getting very wide\napplicability, ppOpen-Math/MP is designed so as that it is independent\nfrom grid structure. Instead of grid structure, PpohMATHMP requires a\ndata set called 'mapping table'. Mapping table is composed of a\ncorrespondence table of grid indexes between a send model and a receive\nmodel and interpolation coefficients. A subroutine for making a mapping\ntable file is provided by ppOpen-Math/MP API. Current version of ppOpen-\nMath/MP is ver.1.0 which targets scalar data exchange. An exchange code\nof vector data which requires rotation calculation is under development\nand will be released the next version.\n",
