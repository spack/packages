Password entry can be invoked in two different\nways: directly from R via the askpass() function, or indirectly as\npassword-entry back-end for 'ssh-agent' or 'git-credential' via the\nSSH_ASKPASS and GIT_ASKPASS environment variables. Thereby the user can\nbe prompted for credentials or a passphrase if needed when R calls out\nto git or ssh."
