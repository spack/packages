    "description": "The Composer of Plots. The 'ggplot2' package provides a strong API for\nsequentially building up a plot, but does not concern itself with\ncomposition of multiple plots. 'patchwork' is a package that expands the\nAPI to allow for arbitrarily complex composition of plots by, among\nothers, providing mathematical operators for combining multiple plots.\nOther packages that try to address this need (but with a different\napproach) are 'gridExtra' and 'cowplot'.\n",

This package provides utilities to aligns associated subplots\nto a main plot at different sides (left, right, top and bottom) with\naxes exactly matched."
